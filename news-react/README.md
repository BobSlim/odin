Hi recruiter!

Please do the following commands in a command prompt to preview this work (assuming you have npm installed):
1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npm run preview

Note that I've used up all my API commands - please wait up to a day after submission to use this. Thanks!

Specs completed:
1 & 2 - news articles are returned correctly based on query. Date/time should be correct.
3 - I couldn't do modals with website content. It seems by CORs policy, you can't just grab other website's stuff to embed in an iframe.

Optional:
Date range, responsive design.
